# Front-End airbnb

This is the front-end of the airbnb clone website, also my first time trying VueJS.
However the MySQL database server runs locally only. I couldn't host it on Cloud for some reasons. Therefore you can't barely get any data.
If there was any data, it would return an alert window that contained data.
